Project Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this project is to develop an IoT Security System. The system will be comprised of one(1)
Gateway device which will act as a server device. One(1) Database which will server as the "back-end"
that contains the functionality to log messages to a master log file. One(1) Door sensor that will send
its status (Open/Closed) to the gateway only when this status changes. One(1) Keychain that will serve 
as a presence beacon and will be on the home-owner's person at all times. One(1) Motion sensor that 
will be capable of detecting motion inside the house. Finally, one(1) Security Device that will sound 
an alarm should an intruder's presence be detected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had the following assumptions during the implementation of our solution:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Since the input file for the door only has one time and then the corresponding state, we assumed that the state of the door at the time was what was listed (inclusive). For Example:
     0,Open
     10,Close
     20,Open   <-We assume that for time 20, the state will be Open, likewise, at time 19, the state will be Close

2) There will not be more than 100 connection attempts made on the Gateway (Total sensors + Total devices <= 100)

3) The size of a message being passed between devices will never exceed 99 characters

4) The door will only send its status to the gateway when the status (Open/Closed) has changed

5) The devices will be ran in the order instructed in the attached instructions.txt file

6) The IP address will be 127.0.0.1 for all devices
