To run the code, run each object (gateway, smartDevice, and sensor) in a new terminal.

Note, if the sensor for areaID = x drops below 32, the output will show that the device for areaID = x turned off the next time the device gets a currValue. (same for if the temperature is above 34). 

To close the socket, type Ctrl-x-c.
